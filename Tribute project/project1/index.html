          <h2>HITMAN</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Rohit Sharma has been synonymous with the term “talent” since he first picked up a cricket bat in his career. 
              There's a lot to like about Rohit Sharma, whether it's his languid batting or his cool and calm demeanor as captain.
               Rohit belongs to the Mumbai school of cricket, and despite a rocky start to his international career in 2007,
                he has gone on to become one of the game's modern-day greats.
